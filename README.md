# Startdo.ing

## Introduction

Explore, have fun, and share the joy with your friends! Startdo.ing is a one-stop shop for a variety of tools and resources that can help you with your everyday tasks, from web development and design to language learning and math games.

## Techstack

What makes Startdo.ing is an interesting project? It is because it uses [Remix Framework](https://remix.run/) as a starting point.

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: Remix
- **UI Framework**: Matine, DaisyUI, Tailwind
- **Deployment platform**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- **File storage**: Cloudflare R2 (Object storage with S3 compatible)

## What got configured

In this project, I try to make the DX the best so many configurations made:

- Lint (unused-imports, prettier-plugin-tailwindcss, add --fix to CLI)
- Typecheck
- Prettier
- Jest (ts-jest)

The only CLI you need to run is `npm run check-all`
